# Movie_Profitability_Prediction_R
This is a machine learning project (April 2020) predicting a movie profitability for IMDB dataset of 5000 movies from Kaggle.

This project basically predicts the profitability-class of a movie based on return on investment of a movie, for which I have used classification models.

Decision tree and neural network models were developed and compared for the evaluation of the effectiveness.

In the initial exploratory analysis, logistic and linear regression classifier were ruled out.

Focus while building the model was on the applicability of the model in the real world and not just the numbers/accuracy of it.
